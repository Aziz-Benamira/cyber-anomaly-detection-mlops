# Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) for Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive analysis of a **2-Expert Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture for network intrusion detection, trained on the CICIDS2017 dataset. The MoE model combines:

1. **Tabular Expert** (FT-Transformer) - Processes non-temporal features
2. **Temporal Expert** (1D CNN) - Processes timing/flow statistics  
3. **Gating Network** - Dynamically weights expert contributions

### Key Results (CICIDS 250k):

| Model | F1-Score | Precision | Recall | Missed Attacks | False Alarms | Training Time |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| **XGBoost** | **99.8%** | 99.7% | 99.9% | **11** | **41** | 114s |
| **MoE (Ours)** | **98.3%** | 97.1% | 99.5% | **70** | **391** | ~4 min |
| FT-Transformer | 96.4% | 93.3% | 99.7% | 44 | 944 | ~13 min |

**Main Achievement**: MoE **improves F1-Score by +1.9%** over single FT-Transformer by leveraging both tabular and temporal features through learned expert specialization.

## 1. Motivation & Architecture Design

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Network intrusion detection faces two key challenges:

1. **Feature Heterogeneity**: Network traffic contains both:
   - **Tabular features**: Protocol flags, packet counts, ports (discrete/categorical)
   - **Temporal features**: Inter-arrival times, flow duration, jitter (time-series statistics)

2. **Class Imbalance**: Real-world traffic is heavily imbalanced (73.6% normal, 26.4% attack in CICIDS)

**Question**: Can we improve detection by using specialized experts for different feature types?

- Steady improvement in precision (92.7% ‚Üí 97.1%)
- Consistently high recall (>99%)
- Gating weights stabilize around 52-56% tabular, 44-48% temporal

### 3.3 Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ **MoE Outperforms Single FT-Transformer**
- **F1-Score**: +1.9% improvement (0.983 vs 0.964)
- **Precision**: +3.8% improvement (0.971 vs 0.933)
- **False Alarms**: -58.6% reduction (391 vs 944)
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more missed attacks (+26: 70 vs 44)

**Interpretation**: MoE's **higher precision** makes it more suitable for production SOCs where false alarms are costly. The gating network learns to trust temporal patterns for attack detection, reducing false positives.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **XGBoost Remains Champion**
- **Why XGBoost wins**: Gradient boosting is highly optimized for tabular data with engineered features
- **When to use MoE**: 
  - Research/academic projects (demonstrates advanced architecture)
  - Multi-modal data (text + tabular, image + tabular)
  - Transfer learning scenarios
  - Interpretability (gating weights show expert specialization)

#### üîç **Gating Network Insights**

**Average Expert Usage**:
- Tabular Expert: **52-56%** (slightly dominant)
- Temporal Expert: **44-48%** (significant contribution)

**Interpretation**:
1. **Balanced weighting** ‚Üí Both experts provide complementary information
2. **Temporal expert ~45%** ‚Üí Timing patterns are crucial for anomaly detection
3. **Variation across epochs** ‚Üí Model explores different expert combinations during training

**Hypothesis** (to be verified in Section 4):
- **DDoS/Flooding attacks** ‚Üí Higher temporal weight (timing anomalies)
- **Port Scans** ‚Üí Higher tabular weight (protocol/port patterns)
- **Web Attacks** ‚Üí Balanced weights (both features matter)

## 4. Expert Specialization Analysis

### 4.1 Gating Weight Distribution

**Summary Statistics** (Epoch 9, Validation Set):

| Expert | Mean Weight | Std | Min | Max | Dominant Samples |
|--------|-------------|-----|-----|-----|------------------|
| Tabular | 0.522 | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.95 | 65% of samples |
| Temporal | 0.478 | 0.18 | 0.05 | 0.95 | 35% of samples |

**Observations**:
- High standard deviation (0.18) indicates **dynamic weighting** per sample
- Both experts can dominate (min/max range: 0.05-0.95)
- Tabular expert preferred in 65% of samples

### 4.2 Attack Type Analysis (Hypothesis)

Based on feature importance in network intrusion detection:

| Attack Type | Expected Dominant Expert | Reasoning |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **DDoS** | Temporal | Flood attacks create timing anomalies (low IAT, high packet rate) |
| **Port Scan** | Tabular | Many unique destination ports, low packet count per port |
| **Brute Force** | Temporal | Repeated connection attempts (timing patterns) |
| **Web Attacks** | Balanced | Both payload features and timing matter |
| **Infiltration** | Temporal | Slow, stealthy ‚Üí unusual flow duration/idle times |

**Next Steps**: 
- Extract gating weights per attack type from validation set
- Visualize weight distributions
- Confirm/refute hypotheses

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ temporal_expert.py     # 1D CNN for temporal features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gating_network.py      # Expert weighting network
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ moe_model.py          # MoE wrapper combining all components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ train_moe.py          # Training script (2-stage)

src/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preprocess.py         # Feature split + preprocessing
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_config.py     # Temporal/tabular feature indices
```

### 6.2 Training Commands

```bash
# Stage 1: Pretrain Tabular Expert (MFM on tabular features only)
python -m src.models.train_moe --stage pretrain

# Stage 2: Train full MoE (end-to-end)
python -m src.models.train_moe --stage train
```

### 6.3 Key Design Decisions

1. **Why 1D CNN for Temporal Expert?**
   - Captures local patterns in temporal statistics (e.g., IAT variance + duration)
   - More efficient than LSTM/RNN for aggregated statistics (not raw sequences)
   - Proven effective for time-series feature extraction

2. **Why not use all 72 features in both experts?**
   - Feature overlap would reduce expert specialization
   - Disjoint features force experts to learn complementary representations
   - Clearer interpretability (which expert handles which patterns)

3. **Why pretrain Tabular Expert separately?**
   - Transfer learning: leverages MFM self-supervised learning
   - Faster convergence: Tabular Expert starts with good representations
   - Ablation study potential: compare with random initialization

4. **Why weighted loss instead of oversampling?**
   - Preserves natural data distribution
   - More realistic evaluation
   - Faster training (no data duplication)

## 7. Limitations & Future Work

### 7.1 Current Limitations

1. **Dataset-Specific**: Feature split tuned for CICIDS/UNSW
2. **Computational Cost**: 6.4x slower than XGBoost
3. **Still behind XGBoost**: For pure tabular data, gradient boosting is hard to beat
4. **No Graph Expert**: Datasets lack IP addresses for graph-based expert

### 7.2 Future Enhancements

#### **Immediate Next Steps**:
- [ ] Train MoE on UNSW-NB15 dataset
- [ ] Analyze gating weights per attack type
- [ ] Visualize expert embeddings (t-SNE/UMAP)
- [ ] Compare with sparse gating (top-k experts only)

#### **Advanced Extensions**:
1. **Attention-Based Gating**: Replace MLP with attention mechanism for better interpretability
2. **More Experts**: 
   - Protocol Expert (TCP/UDP/ICMP patterns)
   - Statistical Expert (entropy, variance, distributions)
3. **Hierarchical MoE**: Gating at multiple levels (coarse + fine-grained)
4. **Cross-Dataset Training**: Train on CICIDS, test on UNSW (generalization)
5. **Real-Time Deployment**: Optimize inference speed with quantization/pruning
6. **Adversarial Robustness**: Test against adversarial evasion attacks
