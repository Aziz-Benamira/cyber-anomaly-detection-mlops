# Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture Analysis for Cybersecurity

## üîç Dataset Analysis: What Data Structures Do We Have?

### ‚úÖ **Expert 1: Tabular Expert** - **FULLY SUPPORTED**

**Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ FT-Transformer (already implemented and trained!)

**Available Data**:
- **CICIDS**: 72 numerical features (flow-level statistics)
- **UNSW**: 39 numerical + 3 categorical features

**Features Include**:
- Connection-level statistics (packets, bytes, duration)
- Protocol flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.)
- Statistical aggregations (mean, std, min, max)
- Flow characteristics (rates, packet sizes, inter-arrival times)

**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY** - FT-Transformer model already trained and achieving excellent results

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Expert 2: Temporal Expert** - **PARTIALLY SUPPORTED**

**Goal**: Capture temporal dependencies and attack patterns over time

**Challenge**: **No explicit timestamps in current datasets!**

#### What We Have (Flow-Level Temporal Features):

Both CICIDS and UNSW provide **aggregated temporal statistics** but **NOT raw packet sequences**:

**CICIDS Temporal Features**:
```python
temporal_features = [
    "Flow Duration",          # Total duration of flow (microseconds)
    "Flow IAT Mean",          # Mean inter-arrival time between packets
    "Flow IAT Std",           # Std dev of inter-arrival times
    "Flow IAT Max",           # Maximum inter-arrival time
    "Flow IAT Min",           # Minimum inter-arrival time
    "Fwd IAT Total/Mean/Std/Max/Min",  # Forward direction timing
    "Bwd IAT Total/Mean/Std/Max/Min",  # Backward direction timing
    "Active Mean/Std/Max/Min",         # Active time before idle
    "Idle Mean/Std/Max/Min",           # Idle time statistics
]
```

**UNSW Temporal Features**:
```python
temporal_features = [
    "dur",           # Flow duration
    "sjit", "djit",  # Source/dest jitter (timing variance)
    "sinpkt", "dinpkt",  # Inter-packet arrival times
    "tcprtt",        # TCP round-trip time
    "synack", "ackdat",  # TCP handshake timing
]
```

#### Workaround: Temporal Feature Expert (RECOMMENDED) ‚≠ê
- Create a specialized MLP/Transformer that focuses on **temporal statistics**
- Input: IAT features, duration, jitter, timing-related columns
- Purpose: Learn temporal attack signatures (e.g., DDoS = low IAT variance, Port Scan = regular IAT patterns)
- **This is NOT true time-series but captures temporal characteristics**

---

### ‚ùå **Expert 3: Graph Expert** - **NOT SUPPORTED**

**Goal**: Capture communication topology (IP ‚Üí IP, port relationships)

**Challenge**: **NO IP ADDRESS DATA in datasets!**

**What's Missing**: No Source IP, No Destination IP, No explicit port pairs

**Workaround Option**: Use UNSW's connection count features (`ct_*`) as pseudo-graph statistics
- `ct_srv_src`: Count of flows to same service from same source
- `ct_dst_ltm`: Count of flows to same dest in last time window
- **NOT a true GNN, but captures graph-like relational properties**

## üéØ Recommended MoE Architecture: **2-Expert System**

```
Input Flow Data
    ‚Üì
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Expert 1: Tabular Expert (FT-Transformer) 
    ‚îÇ   - All features (flow statistics, flags, rates)
    ‚îÇ   - Output: Z_tab (embedding)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Expert 2: Temporal Feature Expert (MLP/Transformer)
        - Focus: IAT, duration, jitter, timing features
        - Output: Z_temporal (embedding)
    
    ‚Üì
Gating Network (MLP)
    - Input: [Z_tab, Z_temporal]
    - Weights: softmax([w_tab, w_temporal])
    - Output: Z_final = w_tab * Z_tab + w_temporal * Z_temporal
    
    ‚Üì
Classifier Head
    - Input: Z_final
    - Output: [Normal, Attack]
```

**Why This Works**:
- ‚úÖ **Honest**: Respects dataset limitations (no IPs, no packet sequences)
- ‚úÖ **Novel**: Temporal expert learns timing-based attack signatures
- ‚úÖ **Practical**: Both experts use available data effectively
- ‚úÖ **Academic**: Demonstrates MoE concept without inventing fake data

## üìã Implementation Plan

### Components to Build:

1. **Temporal Expert** (new)
2. **Gating Network** (new)
3. **MoE Wrapper** (new)
4. **Feature Splitter** in preprocessing (new)
5. **train_moe.py** (new unified training script)

### Next Steps:

Would you like me to:
1. ‚úÖ **Implement 2-Expert MoE** (Tabular + Temporal) - RECOMMENDED
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attempt 3-Expert MoE** (add Relational expert with ct_* features)
3. üìä **Just analyze and document** the architecture design

Ready to start coding when you give the go-ahead! üöÄ
