# Note: This is a template workflow. 
# For actual deployment, you would:
# 1. Add secrets for server credentials (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
# 2. Use SSH or deployment tools to connect to your server
# 3. Pull the Docker images from GitHub Container Registry
# 4. Update and restart your services
# 5. Run health checks and rollback if needed
